                <h3>ABOUT <span>GROOT 1</span></h3>
            </b>

            <p>GR00T N1 Advances Humanoid Developer Community
                The GR00T N1 foundation model features a dual-system architecture, inspired by principles of human
                cognition. “System 1” is a fast-thinking action model, mirroring human reflexes or intuition. “System 2”
                is a slow-thinking model for deliberate, methodical decision-making.

                Powered by a vision language model, System 2 reasons about its environment and the instructions it has
                received to plan actions. System 1 then translates these plans into precise, continuous robot movements.
                System 1 is trained on human demonstration data and a massive amount of synthetic data generated by the
                NVIDIA Omniverse™ platform.

                GR00T N1 can easily generalize across common tasks — such as grasping, moving objects with one or both
                arms, and transferring items from one arm to another — or perform multistep tasks that require long
                context and combinations of general skills. These capabilities can be applied across use cases such as
                material handling, packaging and inspection.

                Developers and researchers can post-train GR00T N1 with real or synthetic data for their specific
                humanoid robot or task.

                In his GTC keynote, Huang demonstrated 1X’s humanoid robot autonomously performing domestic tidying
                tasks using a post-trained policy built on GR00T N1. The robot’s autonomous capabilities are the result
                of an AI training collaboration between 1X and NVIDIA.

                “The future of humanoids is about adaptability and learning,” said Bernt Børnich, CEO of 1X
                Technologies. “While we develop our own models, NVIDIA’s GR00T N1 provides a significant boost to robot
                reasoning and skills. With minimal post-training data, we fully deployed on NEO Gamma — advancing our
                mission of creating robots that are not just tools, but companions capable of assisting humans in
                meaningful, immeasurable ways.”

                Among the additional leading humanoid developers worldwide with early access to GR00T N1 are Agility
                Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Mentee Robotics and NEURA Robotics.</p>

                <h3>More Data to Advance Robotics Post-Training</h3>
            </b>

            <p>Large, diverse, high-quality datasets are critical for robot development but costly to capture. For
                humanoids, real-world human demonstration data is limited by a person’s 24-hour day.

                Announced today, the NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation helps
                address this challenge. Built on Omniverse and NVIDIA Cosmos Transfer world foundation models, the
                blueprint lets developers generate exponentially large amounts of synthetic motion data for manipulation
                tasks from a small number of human demonstrations.

                Using the first components available for the blueprint, NVIDIA generated 780,000 synthetic trajectories
                — the equivalent of 6,500 hours, or nine continuous months, of human demonstration data — in just 11
                hours. Then, combining the synthetic data with real data, NVIDIA improved GR00T N1’s performance by 40%,
                compared with using only real data.

                To further equip the developer community with valuable training data, NVIDIA is releasing the GR00T N1
                dataset as part of a larger open-source physical AI dataset — also announced at GTC and now available on
                Hugging Face.</p>

            </b>

            <p>NVIDIA GR00T N1 training data and task evaluation scenarios are now available for download from Hugging
                Face and GitHub. The NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation is also
                now available as an interactive demo on build.nvidia.com or to download from GitHub.

                The NVIDIA DGX Spark personal AI supercomputer, also announced today at GTC, provides developers a
                turnkey system to expand GR00T N1’s capabilities for new robots, tasks and environments without
                extensive custom programming.

                The Newton physics engine is expected to be available later this year.
